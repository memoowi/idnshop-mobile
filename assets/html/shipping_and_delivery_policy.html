<h1>Shipping & Delivery Policy</h1>

<p>Thank you for your interest in IDNShop! This Shipping & Delivery Policy outlines how we process and deliver your orders.</p>

<h3>Processing Time</h3>

<p>We strive to process and ship your order within 5 business days after receiving your order confirmation. This timeframe may vary depending on product availability and order volume. You will receive a notification with tracking information once your order ships.</p>

<h3>Shipping Methods</h3>

<p>We offer several shipping methods to suit your needs and budget. Shipping costs are calculated based on your order weight, destination, and chosen method. You will see the available shipping options and estimated delivery times during checkout.</p>

<h3>Shipping Restrictions</h3>

<p>We currently only ship within Indonesia. We reserve the right to restrict shipping to certain areas or use alternative carriers based on order content or delivery location.</p>

<h3>Tracking Your Order</h3>

<p>Once your order ships, you will receive a notification with a tracking number. You can track your package's progress on the carrier's website.</p>

<h3>Delivery Confirmation</h3>

<p>A signature may be required upon delivery for certain orders. Please ensure someone is available to receive your package at the designated address.</p>

<h3>Shipping Costs</h3>

<p>Currently, we don't have any free shipping offers. Any order amount will have a shipping fee applied. The exact cost will be calculated at checkout based on your order weight and destination.</p>

<h3>Undelivered Packages</h3>

<p>If your package is marked as undelivered after multiple attempts, it may be returned to our warehouse. We will contact you to arrange for reshipment or a refund. Additional shipping charges may apply for reshipment.</p>

<h3>Customs, Duties, and Taxes</h3>

<p>For international orders (not applicable currently), you may be responsible for import duties, customs fees, and local sales taxes levied by the destination country. These charges are payable to the relevant authority and are not included in the shipping costs we charge. We recommend contacting your local customs office for more information.</p>
